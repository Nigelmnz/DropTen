#DropTen#

DropTen was a game made in 48 hours for a game jam. It combines quick thinking and fast reflexes to create a fun puzzle/math game. Numbers drop down into one of four pods which you control. Each pod tracks the sum of numbers dropped into it. If the sum is 10, your score increases and the pod resets. If it goes over, the pod locks, preventing further use. You have 60 seconds, so act fast!
